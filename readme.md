# Enigma Cipher Machine

A Windows Forms application that simulates the Enigma cipher machine, historically used for encrypting and decrypting secret messages.

## Features

- Simulate the historic Enigma cipher machine.
- Encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Customizable rotor settings and plugboard.
- User-friendly Windows Forms interface.

I focused on how to solve the encryption part. I know the front-end part isn't great.

Note:
- I should not use byte since it's a small project that doesn't need extensive memory or computation.(i cast alot from byte to short)
- Excuse my English. I understand English very well, but I need to practice more on my writing and speaking.
- This is my first project on GitHub.
- I have explained my code inside the project.
- Any suggestions are welcome.
